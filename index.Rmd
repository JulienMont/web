## Research interest

I am interested in developing new MAC and routing protocols for the Internet of Things (IoT) and Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) which raises new constraints due to the limited computational power, memory and energy of devices that compose the network. I am particularly focusing on mobility support in IoT and LPWAN. Formerly, I was working on mobility management over IPv6 networks, from single host mobility to entire network mobility. I had studied all kind of solutions aiming to provide seamless terminal mobility over a wireless environment.

## Research topics

- MAC and routing protocols for IoT and LPWAN
- Mobility management in IoT and LPWAN
- Multihoming in IoT and LPWAN
- Mobile IPv6 and its extensions (NEMO BS, etc.)
- Network experimentations
