## Research interest

My research focuses on the development and optimization of protocols for wireless networks, with a particular emphasis on MAC and routing protocols tailored for dynamic and resource-constrained environments. I am particularly interested in the integration of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) to create programmable wireless networks, offering flexibility and improved performance. Additionally, I explore mobility management and multihoming techniques to enhance the robustness and efficiency of networks, especially in challenging real-world scenarios. My work also involves extensive experimentation and simulation to evaluate the performance and scalability of these solutions in various network settings.

## Research topics

- MAC and routing protocols for wireless networks
- SDN/Programmable wireless networks
- Mobility management
